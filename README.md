ABSTRACT 
a) Importance in Research:
In the research area, Real Time Streaming Protocol plays a significant role in streaming 
multimedia content, it basically focuses on facilitating successful communication between 
client and server. 
b)Issues in this topic:
High Latency and more CPU utilization during Playback cause breaking of immersion of the 
user, and reduce the overall quality of the multimedia while playing.
c)Impact of Issues/Disadvantages:
A user may experience hindrances because of high latency which directly affects the quality 
of multimedia content and reduces the real-time immersion of the user.High Latency directly 
affects the CPU utilization which is also considered one of the drawbacks as it may cause 
slowing down the server.
d)Our Research to remove the current disadvantage 
According to the research and by surfing various websites, we came to the conclusion of 
applying a Machine Learning algorithm -Linear Regression which will help us lower the 
latency and CPU utilization
e)Research Gaps:
Even though the research has already addressed various aspects of the RTSP, there is still a 
bridge that needs to be built for effortless streaming of multimedia content, The High latency 
and CPU utilization being the major.
f)Proposed Algorithm:
Our proposed algorithm aims to address the gap in existing works. Linear Regression works 
on optimizing the number of packets sent and received to minimize the loss and to achieve 
low latency and minimalistic use of CPU resource
